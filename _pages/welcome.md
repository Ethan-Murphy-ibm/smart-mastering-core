# Smart Mastering Framework

## What is the Smart Mastering Framework?
Smart Mastering is a product feature to match and merge entities in a data hub.
It is a capability within the Data Hub Framework that scores matches and merges
data based on configuration to de-duplicate entities.

Smart Mastering improves the quality of data in an operational data hub,
enabling better data insights.

Smart Mastering supports Agile Data Management as an iterative, integral part of
Data Integration -- not yet another siloed architecture or massive standalone
project.

## How Do I get Started?

See the [`examples/minimal-project`][min-project] directory to see how to
include smart-mastering-core in your project.

To make use of the Smart Mastering functionality, your application can either
call the REST API extensions or import XQuery libraries and call the functions
directly.
